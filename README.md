The project is based on [this Material Design template](https://glitch.com/~material-template-portfolio-css). I adapted it to React, using the Parcel CLI instead of Webpack.

I then decided to change its appearance somewhat to resemble 
[this template provided by html5up.net](https://html5up.net/astral)

I learned that React Router does not work smoothly with Github Pages. Github Pages prefers static sites to single page applications. If I were doing this project over again, I would use a static site generator like Gatsby or Jekyll.
