"The Material Design color system can help you create a color theme that reflects your brand or style."
"Color palettes can be generated based on the primary input color, and whether the desired palette should be analogous, complementary, or triadic in relation to the primary color.
Alternatively, the tool can generate expanded palettes, based on any primary and secondary color."
